Quicka than a cruise missile/
Say the Pentagon's reports/
Shine like a diamond while I run da city/
Can't see da haters cuz they dull like quartz/ 
I win Gold everytime, ain't nobody catchin' up/
Call me Applicant One, cuz everyone else a runnerup/
I be siftin' through da code like Wozniak
If Office Luv have a place for me (uh)/ 
Don't wait, emails me back/
